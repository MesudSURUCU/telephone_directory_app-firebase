database: Firebase Realtime Database(import from JSON)
state management: Bloc(Cubit) Pattern

"I have designed a phonebook application that retrieves information from Firebase Realtime Database. The application can display this information on the main page, allows users to add new contacts to the displayed list, and enables the updating of information for existing contacts. Users can also delete saved contacts, and to prevent accidental deletions, the application uses a SnackBar to inform the user. To enhance the stability of the application, I utilized the Bloc pattern for state management."
